Websites are the basic entrance to network access. As the Internet develops faster and faster, the disadvantages of websites gradually appear, large and small loopholes. Hackers use these loopholes to launch attacks on websites, often causing disastrous consequences. Let's get to know each other below

1. SQL injection  
 SQL is the most common vulnerability in websites. Hackers can use this vulnerability to gain administrator permissions, install Trojans and various malicious programs on the website, or directly control the server.

1. XSS cross-site scripting attack vulnerability  
: Through the vulnerability left by website development, malicious instruction code is injected into the website, allowing users to load and execute webpage programs maliciously created by the attacker. CSRF cross-site request forgery, like XSS attacks, has huge harm. The attacker forges the request of the user's browser, inserts malicious HTML code, and sends it using a website that the user has authenticated to visit, causing the target website to receive and mistakenly Execute commands thinking it is the user's real operation, while XSS attacks control the user's browser and obtain some of the user's information by inserting malicious scripts, while CSRF is a method that coerces users to execute on the currently logged-in web application. Unintentional attack method.

1. File upload  
The file upload vulnerability means that the user uploads an executable script file and obtains the ability to execute server-side commands through this script file. This attack method is the most direct and effective. There is no problem with "file upload" itself. The problem is how the server processes and interprets the file after it is uploaded. If the server's processing logic is not secure enough, it will lead to serious consequences.
