# ‚ö†Ô∏è statement
Tools are only for security research or authorized penetration, and you will be responsible for the consequences of illegal use.
PS: Updated from time to time, the file is relatively large and can be downloaded on demand.
Privilege escalation tools can be run in remote Cmd or WebShell. Most of them have been modified and compiled for better compatibility and stability.
