Introduction to dirsearch_bypass403
During security testing, security testers can use it to enumerate directories when collecting information, and fingerprint the directories. The enumerated 403 status directories can be tried to be bypassed. Bypassing 403, it is possible to obtain administrator rights. Does not affect the original function of dirsearch

Run process
dirsearch performs directory scanning—>save all directories with 403 status—>whether to perform jsfind—>yes (perform js to crawl URLs and domain names, and identify the status code of the crawled URL if it is a 403 status, then save it)— > Perform 403 bypass –> Directory for fingerprinting


403bypass : -b yes

python dirsearch.py -u "XXXX" -b yes
jsfind ：-j yes

python dirsearch.py -u "XXXX" -j yes
jsfind and 403bypass: -b yes -j yes

python dirsearch.py -u "XXXX" -j yes -b yes
Bypass the specified directory individually

python single_403pass.py -u "XXXX" -p "/index.php" # -p 指定路径
Perform fingerprint recognition on the scanned directory (the results will be automatically saved in the .josn file in the reports directory)

python dirsearch.py -u "XXXX" -z yes
